\subsubsection{Chomsky Normal Form}\label{subsubsec:chomsky-normal-form}
\begin{definition}
    A context-free language \(G\) is in \textbf{Chomsky Normal Form}\footnote{This is also called \textbf{Chomsky Reduced Form}. Sometimes, Chomsky Normal Form includes the production \(S\to\varepsilon \). In our usage, CNF and CRF are identical and do not include a \(\varepsilon \) production.}if all of its productions are of the form 
    \begin{align*}A &\to BC\\
                  A &\to a\\
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    If \(G\) is a context-free grammar, there exists a Chomsky Normal Form grammar for \(L(G)-\{\varepsilon \} \)
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Greibach Normal Form}\label{subsubsec:greibach-normal-form}
\begin{definition}
    A context-free language is in \textbf{Greibach Normal Form}\footnote{Sometimes, the production \(S\to\varepsilon \) is incuded. In our use, there is no \(\varepsilon \) production.} if all of its productions are of the form
    \[A\to aA_1A_2\hdots A_n\]
